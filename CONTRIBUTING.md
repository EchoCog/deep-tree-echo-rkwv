Based on our [Development Roadmap](docs/development_roadmap.md), here are the current priority areas:

### Critical Priority (P0)
1. **Real RWKV Model Integration** - Replace mock implementation with actual RWKV models
2. **Persistent Memory Architecture** - Implement advanced memory systems with semantic search
3. **Security Framework** - Add authentication, authorization, and data protection

### High Priority (P1)
4. **Advanced Cognitive Processing** - Meta-cognitive reflection and complex reasoning
5. **Scalability & Performance** - Distributed architecture and auto-scaling
6. **Enhanced User Experience** - Advanced UI components and mobile support

### Medium Priority (P2)
7. **API Ecosystem** - Comprehensive APIs and third-party integrations
8. **Advanced Analytics** - Data warehousing and business intelligence

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Code Organization
```python
# Standard library imports
import os
import sys

# Third-party imports
import flask
import numpy as np

# Local imports
from .cognitive_processing import MembraneProcessor
from .rwkv_integration import RWKVBridge
```

### Documentation
- Use docstrings for all functions and classes
- Follow Google-style docstring format
- Include type information and examples

```python
def process_cognitive_request(
    request: str, 
    session_id: str, 
    membranes: List[str]
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Process a cognitive request through specified membranes.
    
    Args:
        request: The user's cognitive processing request
        session_id: Unique identifier for the user session
        membranes: List of membrane names to use for processing
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing processed response and metadata
        
    Example:
        >>> result = process_cognitive_request(
        ...     "What is consciousness?", 
        ...     "session_123", 
        ...     ["memory", "reasoning", "grammar"]
        ... )
        >>> print(result["response"])
    """
```

### Testing Standards
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Aim for 90%+ code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases

```python
def test_cognitive_processing_with_valid_input():
    """Test cognitive processing with valid user input."""
    # Arrange
    request = "Test cognitive request"
    session_id = "test_session"
    
    # Act
    result = process_cognitive_request(request, session_id, ["memory"])
    
    # Assert
    assert result["status"] == "success"
    assert "response" in result
    assert len(result["response"]) > 0
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Membrane-Based Processing
- Each membrane should be independent and focused
- Use clear interfaces between membranes
- Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
- Maintain cognitive processing semantics

### RWKV Integration
- Abstract RWKV-specific code behind interfaces
- Support multiple model variants and sizes
- Implement efficient memory management
- Provide fallback mechanisms for model failures

### WebVM Optimization
- Keep memory usage under 600MB
- Optimize for browser deployment
- Implement efficient caching strategies
- Use progressive loading for large resources

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
3. **Performance Tests** - Validate performance requirements
4. **Security Tests** - Check for vulnerabilities
5. **User Acceptance Tests** - Validate user workflows

### Running Tests
